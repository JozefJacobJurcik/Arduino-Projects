# Arduino Projects (Hobby)

This repository contains a collection of personal Arduino projects created as part of a hobby. The code and organization may not be fully optimized or polished, as these projects are ongoing and created during my free time. I plan to improve them in the future as I continue experimenting and learning.

### Contributing
